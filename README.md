# ORM_Burger_App

Eat-Da-Burger/Burger City is an app that allows users to input the names of new burgers, to "devour" burgers by clicking a button, and to recreate those burgers (effectively "un-devouring" them) by clicking another button. Devoured burgers and undevoured burgers are displayed separately, with text and button labels that make clear which is which. 

As with a number of other projects completed as part of the Michigan State University Web Dev Coding Bootcamp program, colors reflect MSU brand colors. Learn more about the brand colors here -- https://brand.msu.edu/design-visual/index.html
